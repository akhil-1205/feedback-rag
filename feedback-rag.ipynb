It also talks about the Network and Sharing Center for setting up connections. However, the specific steps for Bluetooth might be in the \"Connecting to a wireless network\" section, but that's under WLAN.

The context does mention that Bluetooth creates a PAN, but the steps for connecting via Bluetooth might be similar to the WLAN steps but with Bluetooth instead.

The user might need to use the Network and Sharing Center, but the context doesn't specify Bluetooth steps. However, the context does mention that from the Start screen, you can type help, and there are steps for connecting to a WLAN.

      "The context mentions a Bluetooth device which creates a personal area network (PAN). It says that in a PAN, each device communicates directly with others and must be relatively close together—typically within 25 meters (approximately 82 feet) of each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the key point here is that the Bluetooth range is about 25 meters. I should check if there's any other information that might contradict or add to this. The rest of the context talks about WLAN connections, but the Bluetooth part specifically states 25 meters. The note about being out of range for WLAN is separate, so it's not relevant here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer should be that the Bluetooth range is typically within 25 meters or approximately 82 feet.\n",
